# University Domains and Names Data List & API

Do you need a list of universities and their domain names? You found it!

This package includes a JSON file that contains domains, names and countries of most of the universities of the world.
 - You can create a validation script that checks the email domain.
 - You can automatically generate a user's country and university by looking at their emails.


You can use this data source in three ways:
 - Use the JSON file as your data source and do whatever you like with your favourite programming language.
 - Use free hosted-API.
 - Use the tiny Python app to serve a fast API that you can query data.

### Update - New structure

After September of 2017, we changed our structure to support multiple domains and web pages. With this update, we added a State/Province field, "domain" and "web_page" fields changed as list with "domains" and "web_pages" fields respectively.

### 1 - Using the Data Source

The whole data source is located in the `world_universities_and_domains.json` file. It is just a list of dictionaries in the following format:

	[
		...
		{
		    "alpha_two_code": "TR",
		    "country": "Turkey",
		    "state-province": null,
		    "domains": [
		        "sabanciuniv.edu",
		        "sabanciuniv.edu.tr"
		    ],
		    "name": "Sabanci University",
		    "web_pages": [
		        "http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/",
		        "http://www.sabanciuniv.edu.tr/"
		    ],
		},
		...
	]


NOTE: Some universities use a format like `[user]@[department].[domain]`, but this list only contains the `[domain]` portion.
For example, an email address might be `[student]@cs.usc.edu`, and this list will contain 'usc.edu', the domain for the
University of Southern California. Take this into consideration if using this list for email address validation.

### 2 - Using Hosted API

This is the easiest method if you're making a small project or just want to discover the data without any hassle.
It is sponsored by [Hipo](http://www.hipolabs.com) and free. If you have a big project, please host it on your own server.

Some example searches:

 - http://universities.hipolabs.com
 - http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle
 - http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle&country=turkey

The hosted API uses [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api) package.


### 3 - Using the built-in API on your server

You can access the python API via [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api)
